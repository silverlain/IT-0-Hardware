# IT-0-Hardware
This repository documents concepts relating to computing hardware, which is the physical technology on which all implemented IT software runs on. Improvements and changes in hardware design occur constantly and cascade upwards, resulting in changes to computing paradigms, standards, frameworks, patterns, and applications to optimize the development and performance of software running on the underlying hardware.
