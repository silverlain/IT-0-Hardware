# IT-0-Machinese
This repository documents concepts relating to hardware, memory storage, and operating systems, which are the fundamental computing technologies on which all implemented IT software runs on. Improvements and changes in hardware, memory, and OS occur constantly and cascade upwards, resulting in changes to computing paradigms, standards, frameworks, patterns, and applications to optimize the development and performance of software running on the underlying hardware.
