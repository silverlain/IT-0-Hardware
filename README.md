# IT-0-Machines
This repository documents concepts relating to hardware, memory storage, and operating systems, which are the fundamental computing technologies on which all implemented IT software runs on. Improvements and changes in hardware, memory, and OS occur constantly and cascade upwards, resulting in changes to computing paradigms, standards, frameworks, patterns, and applications to optimize the development and performance of software running on the underlying hardware.

[Building Analogy]
Machines = Physical materials available to work with and their integrators, such as brick, cement, wood, steel, and connectors such as nails, cement, and rivets.


Organization - "How these types of projects can be managed in the best ways possible."

Applications - "The finished house built to the customer's specifications."

Patterns- "Floor plans that make the house comfortable to live in and easy to maintain."

Frameworks - "A basic modular design for a house that is structurally sound."

Standards- "Using the metric system, bricks should all be 0.05 m x 0.2 m x 0.05 m."

Paradigms - "Bricks are best used when stacked tightly for building exterior walls."

Machines - "Bricks, wooden boards, cement, and steel are available to work with."
